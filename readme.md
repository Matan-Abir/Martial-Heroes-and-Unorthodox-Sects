To run the demo, download all the files and then run "WorldGenBuild 31.5.2018.exe"

This is a Unity game I briefly worked on. The idea was that it was set in medieval China, and
most of the content is randomized based on a seed each time the player starts a new game. The world,
the characters, the factions, the martial arts, and everything. It was probably a bit much for
me back in 2018, and the "type" of game I initially conceived it as was probably too much for
a young developer to work on by himself.

In the below image is the world-generation screen. The player can use the UI inputs around the map
to create a different world each time based on some specification (the map will not change unless
"Generate World" is pressed), and assuming the exact same options and seed, the same map will always
generate, every time.

This second image allows the player to select which faction (settlement) he wants to start as a 
member of. The factions are randomly generated whenever the world is created, and the player can
select his faction with the green left/right arrows at the top, which will then highlight
the selected faction on the map, in purple. This is the end of the demo.

Here's a nice unused transition to a loading screenthat would've made it into the game had work continued.

If anyone reads this and it in any way inspires him to make this game? Go ahead. Just let me know
first because I'd love to play it!
